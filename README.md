# Digit-Recognition
This repo is my attempt to explore the **MNIST** data and build a classification model which can identify digits based on the images.
I have tried building *simple models* in R using `random forest` and a simple `neural network` in R and compare thier performances.
It is a great experince of trying simpler/traditional models on image data before we dwell in the field of deep learning and CNN's.
